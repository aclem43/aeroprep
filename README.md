# Complete Restart 
Aeroprep will be restarted from scratch with native mobile technologies. This is primarily to improve the apps performance in important functions such as the map page and geolocation. This will also enable features to be better integrated with the OS.

## Technology Ideas
The following will be explored before deciding on a technology
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
- Android

## Now
All issues have been closed
The branches will be moved to a new parent branch called "version-1"

## Version 2 
With a complete restart the project goals have changed 
The app will now mostly focus around the map, with better integration with airspace, aerodromes and your planned/recorded route
